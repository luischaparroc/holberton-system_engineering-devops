# Postmortem
Sample Postmortem: Outage Resolution

##Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: September 15, 2023, 14:00 UTC
End Time: September 15, 2023, 17:30 UTC
Impact:
Service Affected: E-commerce Website
Users Affected: 80% of users experienced slow page loading and checkout failures.
##Root Cause:

The root cause of the outage was an unexpected surge in traffic due to a flash sale event. Our load balancer's auto-scaling mechanism failed to respond adequately, causing server congestion.

##Timeline:

Detection Time: September 15, 2023, 14:15 UTC
Detected by automated monitoring alert for high server load.
Actions Taken:
Investigated server logs and identified increased traffic.
Assumed it was a DDoS attack initially.
Misleading Paths:
Focused on network security logs.
Engaged the security team unnecessarily.
Escalation:
Incident escalated to the DevOps team.
SREs involved due to the severity of the issue.
Resolution:
Scaled server capacity manually to accommodate traffic.
Implemented rate limiting to mitigate impact.
Regular updates were posted on the website to keep users informed.
Root Cause and Resolution:

The issue was caused by a surge in genuine user traffic, not a DDoS attack. Our auto-scaling algorithm was not optimized to handle such rapid traffic spikes. To resolve it, we manually scaled up server capacity and adjusted the auto-scaling algorithm parameters to respond more effectively to sudden traffic surges.

##Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Optimize auto-scaling parameters for more dynamic scaling.
Implement more robust traffic monitoring and alerting systems.
Enhance communication protocols for cross-functional incident response.
Establish a post-incident review process to capture lessons learned.
This outage highlighted the importance of continuously improving our infrastructure's scalability and incident response capabilities. We are committed to implementing these measures to ensure uninterrupted service for our users.
